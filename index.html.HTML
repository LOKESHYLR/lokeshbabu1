                Success is often defined as the ability to reach your goals in life, 
                whatever those goals may be. In some ways, 
                a better  word for success might be attainment, accomplishment, 
                or progress. It is not necessarily a destination but a journey
                that helps develop the skills and resources you need to thrive.

                A library is a collection of sources of information and similar resources, made accessible to a defined community for
                reference or borrowing. It provides physical or digital access to material and may be a physical building or room, or a
                virtual space, or both. A library's collection can include books, periodicals, newspapers, manuscripts, films, maps,
                prints, documents, microform, CDs, cassettes, videotapes, DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, e-books, audiobooks, databases, and other
                formats. Libraries range in size from a few shelves of books to several million items. Sidney Sheldon perfectly
                describes: “Libraries store the energy that fuels the imagination. They open up windows to the world and inspire us to
                explore and achieve, and contribute to improving our quality of life.”

        Gameplay
        The player's character, after waking up from some incident, finds himself with a pair of gloves that can interact with
        specific blocks that are in the walls, floors, and ceilings of the various rooms as he progresses. The function of the
        blocks are distinguished by colour: red blocks can be extended or retracted; yellow blocks, always in groups of three,
        can be used to make stair-like structures; blue blocks can be retracted to act like a springboard to whatever touches
        them; purple blocks provide means to rotate sections of walls of a room; and green blocks provide a sphere or cube,
        which the player will need to manipulate. In the early stages, the player's goal is to use a combination of these blocks
        to get themselves to an exit point, allowing them to move to the next chamber.[2]
        
        As the player progresses deeper into the unknown complex, new puzzle aspects are introduced. In one stage, the bulk of
        the chambers are dark except for specific coloured blocks, requiring the player to remember the location of other blocks
        as they manipulate them.[3] Another section features light-oriented puzzles, with the player using cubes and other
        features to orient the light beam in the correct fashion.[4]
            explore and achieve, and contribute to improving our quality of life.”
